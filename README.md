# weather-app

this is a weather app, created using a boilerplate of my own for react, ssr, express, sass and typescript

to run this app first you gotta install all dependencies with

```
npm install
```

after that you need to run 2 commands in 2 different tabs of your preferred terminal

```
npm run watch
```

and in the 2nd tab

```
npm run start-dev
```
